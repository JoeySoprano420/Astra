This framework ensures a scalable, multi-language virtual machine tailored for AstraPrime and other supported languages. You can now handle code execution, GUI interaction, and extended language translation across platforms. The VM uses MDRI-FILES for interpretation and translation, and EAL ensures the system can handle both assembly and machine-level code based on resource availability.
