Uses matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.
The transformation matrix for Fibonacci is:
| 1 1 |

The fibonacci_interaction function allows users to input their desired Fibonacci term count and displays results, execution times, and the complete Fibonacci sequence for both methods.
Conclusion
This implementation of the AstraPrime language significantly enhances the Fibonacci functions by adding robust error handling, memoization, execution time measurement, and user interaction. The language becomes more user-friendly and efficient for computing Fibonacci sequences, making it ideal for educational purposes, algorithmic studies, or game development.

To expand and increase the Fibonacci sequence implementation in the AstraPrime language, and to introduce polyconditionals (complex conditional statements that handle multiple conditions simultaneously), I'll extend the previous functions. Polyconditionals can be especially useful in optimizing certain decision-making scenarios and handling edge cases more effectively.

This version will:

Expand the Fibonacci functionality by providing options for different sequence types.
Add polyconditionals to streamline condition checks.
Optimize performance by reducing unnecessary computations.
Enhance error handling by introducing better checks for invalid inputs.
Introduce sequence types, such as modulo-based Fibonacci and truncated Fibonacci, to handle additional sequence generation requirements.

Explanation of Enhancements and Expansions
Polyconditionals:

Introduced in the fibonacci_polyconditional function to handle multiple types of Fibonacci sequences (standard, modulo, and truncated) using a polyconditional structure. This simplifies decision-making and allows flexible mode selection without redundant code.
Advanced Fibonacci Modes:

Standard Mode: The classic Fibonacci sequence using memoization.
Modulo Mode: A version where the Fibonacci numbers are reduced by a modulus (useful for certain cryptographic or algorithmic applications).
Truncated Mode: This stops generating the Fibonacci sequence after a certain value, limiting the results for specific use cases.
Input Validation and Error Handling:

All functions now check for invalid inputs, including non-integer values for n, invalid modulus values, and negative numbers.
Polyconditional validation ensures that appropriate modes and values are selected based on user input.
User Interaction:

Enhanced the user interaction with options to choose between standard, modulo, and truncated Fibonacci sequences.

To greatly reduce and stifle startup and load time in AstraPrime, we can implement several optimizations that streamline initialization processes, minimize resource overhead, and accelerate execution. Here's how we can achieve that:

Key Optimizations:
Lazy Loading: Only load essential modules and components during startup; defer the loading of non-critical features until they are needed.
Precompilation and Caching: Precompile code and cache the results to avoid re-compilation during startup.
Code Minification and Compression: Compress resources and minimize code to reduce data transfer and execution times.
Optimized Memory Management: Use memory efficiently to prevent excessive load on system resources, which can delay startup.
Parallel Initialization: Run startup tasks in parallel threads to take advantage of multi-core processors.
Preemptive Resource Allocation: Allocate resources in advance where possible, reducing time spent acquiring resources at runtime.

Breakdown of Optimizations:
Precompilation and Caching:

Precompile critical modules: During the initial startup, the system will compile frequently-used code into an intermediate state and store it in a cache. When the system starts again, it will retrieve the precompiled code, significantly reducing load times.
Lazy Loading:

Instead of loading every feature and module at startup, non-critical components are loaded only when necessary. This reduces initial memory usage and speeds up the startup process.
Parallel Initialization:

Multi-threading allows the system to initialize multiple subsystems simultaneously, such as graphics, networking, and input/output operations, speeding up the entire process.
Preemptive Resource Allocation:

Resources like memory or file handles are allocated in advance to avoid runtime bottlenecks. This prevents the system from pausing during execution to acquire additional resources.
Memory Management:

Efficient memory allocation ensures the system uses only what it needs during startup, preventing slowdowns caused by memory bloat.
Additional Optimizations:
Code Minification:

Minify and compress code before deployment to reduce file size and resource consumption.
Profiling and Code Tracing:

Analyze startup performance and identify bottlenecks with real-time profiling to optimize critical areas, ensuring even greater reductions in startup time.

By implementing these optimization techniques, startup and load times will be drastically reduced, making AstraPrime significantly more responsive while handling resource-intensive tasks efficiently.

To infinitely amplify the mid-level programming acumen of AstraPrime, we'll focus on a set of improvements that blend intuitive ease of use with advanced power for developers, allowing them to scale their expertise. These enhancements should ensure AstraPrime remains easy to approach while providing deep functionality for intermediate programmers to tackle complex tasks. Here’s the plan for prolific improvement:

Key Focus Areas:
Modular Design: Expand modularity for reusable and interchangeable components.
Abstract Data Structures: Introduce advanced, intuitive data structures and algorithms while keeping the interface accessible.
Flexible Syntax with Auto-optimization: Develop a forgiving, expressive syntax that the compiler automatically optimizes.
Macro-Level Control: Provide fine-grained control over execution and flow while abstracting away unnecessary complexity.
Built-in Best Practices: Encourage efficient programming through built-in functions that adhere to modern best practices.
Tooling for Debugging, Testing, and Profiling: Simplify complex debugging, testing, and profiling processes with robust, developer-friendly tools.
1. Modular Design for Reusability
Modular programming allows users to easily structure their code into reusable blocks. Introduce an extended library of modules that cover various utilities: file systems, networking, encryption, and more.

Conclusion:
With these improvements, AstraPrime's mid-level programming acumen will be amplified exponentially, providing an incredible range of intuitive features while gradually introducing more powerful tools as developers grow their skills. The language will remain easy to start with, while offering rich, advanced capabilities for those wanting to take their development to the next level.
