Standard Fibonacci Function:

A recursive implementation that computes the Fibonacci number based on the defined sequence.
Time Complexity: O(2^n), which becomes inefficient for larger n.
Exponential Fibonacci Function:

Uses matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.
The transformation matrix for Fibonacci is:
| 1 1 |

The matrix_mult function performs matrix multiplication, and the matrix_pow function calculates the power of the matrix using exponentiation by squaring, allowing us to compute the Fibonacci number in O(log n) time.
Example Function:

fibonacci_example() demonstrates how to use both functions to compute Fibonacci numbers for a given value of n.

3. Test the Implementation
To ensure everything works correctly, you can run the fibonacci_example() function, which will print the Fibonacci numbers generated by both methods for n = 10.

Performance Measurement:

The measure_execution_time function measures the time taken to compute the Fibonacci number, providing insight into the performance of each method.
User Interaction:

The fibonacci_interaction function allows users to input their desired Fibonacci term count and displays results, execution times, and the complete Fibonacci sequence for both methods.
Conclusion
This implementation of the AstraPrime language significantly enhances the Fibonacci functions by adding robust error handling, memoization, execution time measurement, and user interaction. The language becomes more user-friendly and efficient for computing Fibonacci sequences, making it ideal for educational purposes, algorithmic studies, or game development.

To expand and increase the Fibonacci sequence implementation in the AstraPrime language, and to introduce polyconditionals (complex conditional statements that handle multiple conditions simultaneously), I'll extend the previous functions. Polyconditionals can be especially useful in optimizing certain decision-making scenarios and handling edge cases more effectively.

This version will:

Expand the Fibonacci functionality by providing options for different sequence types.
Add polyconditionals to streamline condition checks.
Optimize performance by reducing unnecessary computations.
Enhance error handling by introducing better checks for invalid inputs.
Introduce sequence types, such as modulo-based Fibonacci and truncated Fibonacci, to handle additional sequence generation requirements.

Explanation of Enhancements and Expansions
Polyconditionals:

Introduced in the fibonacci_polyconditional function to handle multiple types of Fibonacci sequences (standard, modulo, and truncated) using a polyconditional structure. This simplifies decision-making and allows flexible mode selection without redundant code.
Advanced Fibonacci Modes:

Standard Mode: The classic Fibonacci sequence using memoization.
Modulo Mode: A version where the Fibonacci numbers are reduced by a modulus (useful for certain cryptographic or algorithmic applications).
Truncated Mode: This stops generating the Fibonacci sequence after a certain value, limiting the results for specific use cases.
Input Validation and Error Handling:

All functions now check for invalid inputs, including non-integer values for n, invalid modulus values, and negative numbers.
Polyconditional validation ensures that appropriate modes and values are selected based on user input.
User Interaction:

Enhanced the user interaction with options to choose between standard, modulo, and truncated Fibonacci sequences.
For the modulo and truncated versions, additional parameters (modulus, truncation limit) can be specified by the user.
Memoization:

The memoization technique continues to be applied in the standard Fibonacci function for improved efficiency by caching results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers.
Output Formatting:

The interaction function prints out the result based on the user-selected Fibonacci mode, providing clear feedback on the sequence.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n using the desired method (standard, modulo, etc.).
Step 2: Use a plotting function to visualize the sequence as a graph.

Sequence Customization: Prime, Odd/Even Fibonacci
To add custom sequence generation rules, such as generating prime Fibonacci numbers, odd Fibonacci numbers, or even Fibonacci numbers, we will introduce filters.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Create a function to check whether a number is prime.
Step 2: Define functions that generate Fibonacci numbers filtered by conditions (prime, odd, or even).
Step 3: Use the existing Fibonacci function and apply the filters.

Conclusion
