### **Core Features of AstraPrime**

---

#### **1. Language Structure and Syntax**

AstraPrime uses a clean, readable syntax with powerful abstractions and polyconditionals (multiple condition handling). It is structured around keywords like `DEFINE`, `CALL`, `RETURN`, and `INCLUDE`, making code writing and debugging intuitive.

The language's fundamental structure supports:

- **Functions**: Reusable code blocks with optional arguments and return values.
- **Classes and Structs**: Object-oriented features that allow encapsulation of data and behavior.
- **Conditionals**: Simple and polyconditionals to manage complex logic.

```plaintext
DEFINE FUNCTION my_function(param1, param2):
    IF param1 == param2 THEN:
        PRINT "Values are equal"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "Values are not equal"
    END_IF
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **2. Advanced Data Types and Structures**

AstraPrime provides a variety of built-in data types, including primitive types like `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`, as well as more complex structures such as arrays, vectors, matrices, and user-defined types.

- **Vectors and Matrices**: Easily manipulated for mathematical operations.
- **Classes**: For encapsulating data and methods, offering a full object-oriented programming experience.
  
```plaintext
DEFINE TYPE Vector:
    DEFINE MEMBER x AS FLOAT
    DEFINE MEMBER y AS FLOAT
END_TYPE

DEFINE STRUCTURE Matrix:
    DEFINE MEMBER rows AS INTEGER
    DEFINE MEMBER cols AS INTEGER
    DEFINE MEMBER data AS ARRAY[ARRAY[FLOAT]]
END_STRUCTURE
```

---

#### **3. Performance Optimization**

One of AstraPrime's defining features is its performance optimization techniques. It supports Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and memoization for faster recursive algorithms, making it perfect for computationally intense tasks like large Fibonacci calculations.

- **Multithreading**: Distributed parallel computation for enhanced performance.
- **Memoization**: Cache results to avoid redundant calculations in recursive functions.
- **JIT Compilation**: Optimizes runtime performance by compiling code on the fly.

```plaintext
DEFINE GLOBAL memo = {}

DEFINE FUNCTION fibonacci(n):
    IF n IN memo THEN RETURN memo[n]
    ELSE IF n == 0 THEN RETURN 0
    ELSE IF n == 1 THEN RETURN 1
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    RETURN memo[n]
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **4. Multithreading and Concurrency**

AstraPrime natively supports multithreading, making it possible to handle tasks in parallel. This is especially useful for large data processing, machine learning algorithms, and real-time applications.

- **Thread Management**: Create, manage, and join threads easily.
- **Semaphores**: Handle concurrent access to shared resources.
- **Locks and Synchronization**: Ensure safe multithreaded execution.

```plaintext
# Example: Multithreaded Fibonacci Calculation
DEFINE FUNCTION fibonacci_multithreaded(n):
    IF n < 2 THEN RETURN n
    thread1 = CREATE_THREAD fibonacci(n - 1)
    thread2 = CREATE_THREAD fibonacci(n - 2)
    RETURN WAIT_THREAD(thread1) + WAIT_THREAD(thread2)
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **5. Robust Error Handling**

AstraPrime's error handling system is designed to be flexible and robust. It allows the capture of exceptions with `TRY`, `CATCH`, and `RAISE` constructs. The system integrates automatic logging and recovery mechanisms to ensure the smooth execution of programs even under unpredictable conditions.

```plaintext
DEFINE EXCEPTION DivideByZero: "Cannot divide by zero."

DEFINE FUNCTION safe_divide(a, b):
    TRY:
        IF b == 0 THEN RAISE DivideByZero
        RETURN a / b
    CATCH DivideByZero:
        PRINT "Error: Division by zero."
        RETURN 0  # Default error value
    END_CATCH
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **6. File Handling and Networking**

AstraPrime is fully equipped to handle file input/output operations and networking tasks with ease. From reading and writing files to managing sockets and performing HTTP requests, the language's built-in libraries support common and advanced I/O operations.

```plaintext
# Example: File Handling
INCLUDE_LIBRARY "file_handling"

DEFINE FUNCTION read_file(filename):
    FILE content = READ_FILE(filename)
    RETURN content
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **7. Advanced Templating and Meta-programming**

Templating allows for reusable, generic code that can handle various types and structures. This makes AstraPrime a powerful tool for meta-programming and code generation. It supports parametric polymorphism and multiple dispatch, allowing templates to handle various data types.

```plaintext
DEFINE FUNCTION sort<T>(array AS ARRAY[T]):
    # Sorting logic
    RETURN sorted_array
END_FUNCTION

numbers = ARRAY[INTEGER] {5, 2, 8, 1}
sorted_numbers = sort(numbers)
```

---

#### **8. Graphical and Visualization Tools**

AstraPrime provides extensive support for graphical data visualization. Whether you're plotting Fibonacci sequences, creating complex graphs, or visualizing datasets, the language comes with powerful tools for graphical output.

```plaintext
INCLUDE_LIBRARY "graphics"

DEFINE FUNCTION visualize_fibonacci(n):
    data = []
    FOR i = 0 TO n:
        APPEND(data, fibonacci(i))
    CREATE_GRAPH(data)
    DISPLAY_GRAPH()
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **9. Security and Code Integrity**

AstraPrime places a strong emphasis on security. The language includes features like code signing, encryption for sensitive data, and tamper-proofing mechanisms. This ensures that code execution remains secure from external threats.

- **ProxyCode and Encryption**: To protect code integrity.
- **Tamper-proofing**: Built-in systems to detect and handle any external tampering attempts.

```plaintext
SECURE CODE "password_protected_code" ENCRYPTED
```

---

#### **10. Code Profiling and Debugging**

AstraPrime comes with extensive profiling and debugging capabilities to help developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their applications.

- **Code Profiling**: Detailed runtime analysis for performance tracking.
- **Tracebacks and Logs**: Automated tracing of function calls and error handling for easier debugging.
- **Auto-tuning**: Mechanisms for optimizing runtime configurations based on workload characteristics.

```plaintext
DEFINE FUNCTION profile_execution(func):
    START_TIMER()
    func()  # Execute the function
    END_TIMER()
    PRINT "Execution time: " + ELAPSED_TIME()
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **11. Sequence Customization and Generation**

AstraPrime supports advanced sequence generation, including customizable Fibonacci sequences (e.g., prime Fibonacci, even Fibonacci, odd Fibonacci, truncated Fibonacci). These are highly optimized for efficient computation and performance.

```plaintext
DEFINE FUNCTION fibonacci_prime(n):
    fib_num = fibonacci(n)
    IF is_prime(fib_num) THEN RETURN fib_num
    ELSE RETURN 0
END_FUNCTION
```

---

#### **12. Templating and Auto-Sourcing**

AstraPrime offers an intelligent templating system for auto-sourcing, linking references, and citations. This feature enables code to be auto-cited, and referenced materials can be dynamically pulled into the project to maintain efficiency in code referencing.
